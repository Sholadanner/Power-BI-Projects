# Nuclear Weapons Data Analysis (Power BI Project)

> **"80 years ago today, the United States tested the first nuclear bomb, ushering the world into a new age."**

This Power BI project explores the global development of nuclear weapons from 1945 to the present. Through this analysis, I aimed to better understand global stockpiles, testing trends, and the historical events that shaped nuclear proliferation and disarmament over the past eight decades.

## Project Overview

Using publicly available data, this dashboard presents insights into:

- Global nuclear warhead stockpiles by country and year  
- Nuclear weapon testing trends (atmospheric and underground)  
- Historical context around global disarmament efforts  
- The growing taboo against nuclear testing  

---

## Key Insights

1. **Current Global Arsenal:**  
   There are **9,614 active nuclear warheads** in the world today, distributed among just **9 countries**. **Russia** holds the largest arsenal with **2,591 active warheads**.

2. **US & Russia Dominate:**  
   The **United States and Russia** together possess **87%** of the world’s nuclear weapons.

3. **The Cold War Effect:**  
   Since the first bomb in **1945**, global nuclear stockpiles grew rapidly, peaking in **1986** with **64,452 warheads**—mostly due to Cold War tensions. Since then, stockpiles have seen a **significant and steady decline** due to disarmament efforts.

4. **Nuclear Tests Conducted:**  
   A total of **2,056 nuclear tests** have been carried out globally. The most powerful detonation ever recorded had a blast yield of **50 megatons**.

5. **Test Moratorium Impact:**  
   A sharp drop in testing occurred between **1959–60**, coinciding with the **nuclear test moratorium** between the United States and the Soviet Union.

6. **Recent Developments:**  
   In the **past 20 years**, only **6 nuclear tests** have been conducted—all by **North Korea**, with the last test taking place in **2017**. This suggests that the **global taboo against nuclear testing is stronger than ever**.

## What I Learned

This project gave me a deeper appreciation for how data can be used to explore:
- **Global security dynamics**
- **Historical arms races**
- **Ongoing nuclear risks and disarmament trends**

By visualizing complex historical data, I was able to tell a story about the rise and fall of nuclear weapons in the modern era.
